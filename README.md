# ðŸŽ“ College Placement Prediction

A **Machine Learning + Flask Web App** that predicts whether a student will be placed in a company based on their academic and personal attributes.  
This project demonstrates **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** for binary classification.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Web-based interface built with **Flask**.
- Predicts placement chances based on:
  - IQ
  - Previous Semester Result
  - CGPA
  - Academic Performance
  - Internship Experience
  - Extra Curricular Score
  - Communication Skills
  - Projects Completed
- Visualizes the output as a clear prediction message.
- Comparison of **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains student academic and extracurricular details with placement status (`Placed / Not Placed`) as the target.

---

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**
  - Train Accuracy: `88.5%`
  - Test Accuracy: `88.8%`
  - Balanced Recall
- **Decision Tree**
  - Train Accuracy: `83.4%`
  - Test Accuracy: `83.4%`
  - Lower recall

âœ… Logistic Regression performed better for this dataset.
